# project:WILD

Description:
This is a personal game pitch website for a fictional 5v5 game. It's designed to sell the game idea through enticing descrptions and interesting illustrations and sleek web design. 

Challenges:
This was my first attempt at web design. I wanted to challenge myself and use both my artistic and technical abilities to bring a website alive. All visuals (illustration, logos, layout) was designed by me. Lack of familiarity with HTML and CSS foundations meant a lot of time spent on researching and misuse of certain tags and effects. Some challenges include:
                - Layout properties
                - Using more specific tags
                - Lack of understanding on CSS targeting
                
This project has given me a lot of insight on HTML and CSS foundation while giving me a hands-on introduction on how Java-script interacts with HTML code. I'm very happy with the final visual of the website but I hope to have more interactivity and allowing the website to adujust more easily to different web browser cite.


Uses:
This project could be a template for game pitch websites. Illustrations, logos, and text can be swapped out by editing "src=" from each div.
